.SH NAME
o2ef \- Filter for error messages generated by o2c
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B o2c
.I ... | 
.B o2ef
.RI [ -c | -l | -L ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B
o2ef 
filters error messages generated by 
.B o2c 
and transforms them into
another textual representation.  This is only intended as a help for
those who either can't use the Oberon-2 Emacs mode (that's
regrettable) or who don't want to use Emacs (a grave mistake).  
.br  
.B o2ef 
reads the errors emitted by 
.B o2c 
from 
.I stdin 
and writes them to
.I stdout 
in a new format, e.g. like a C compiler's errors.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c	
Print errors in source text context (default).  Each line of
source code containing an error is printed with a few lines of
leading and trailing lines.  The error position is marked,
followed by the error text.
.TP
.B -l
Print errors in the format 
.IR file:line:error .
This is the format used by 
.B gcc 
to describe errors.  Only the line number
containing the error is printed, the exact error position is
lost.  Many error messages will lose a lot of their
usefulness since the exact error position carries a great
deal of information.  Rather use 
.B -L
instead.
.TP
.B -L
Print errors in the format 
.IR file:line,column:error .
